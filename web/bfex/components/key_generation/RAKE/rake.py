# Implementation of RAKE - Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction algorithm
# as described in:
# Rose, S., D. Engel, N. Cramer, and W. Cowley (2010). 
# Automatic keyword extraction from individual documents.
# In M. W. Berry and J. Kogan (Eds.), Text Mining: Applications and Theory.unknown: John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.
#
# NOTE: The original code (from https://github.com/aneesha/RAKE)
# has been extended by a_medelyan (zelandiya)
# with a set of heuristics to decide whether a phrase is an acceptable candidate
# as well as the ability to set frequency and phrase length parameters
# important when dealing with longer documents
#
# NOTE 2: The code published by a_medelyan (https://github.com/zelandiya/RAKE-tutorial)
# has been additionally extended by Marco Pegoraro to implement the adjoined candidate
# feature described in section 1.2.3 of the original paper. Note that this creates the
# need to modify the metric for the candidate score, because the adjoined candidates
# have a very high score (because of the nature of the original score metric)
